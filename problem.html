            <div class = problemp> <p>Dealing with  bad habits might be something you would want do on your own, as sharing these problems might be taboo. That is why we created Quitly, to have a personal and at the same time anonymous way for dealing with quitting bad habits. To make quitting easier, we have made a forum section for people quitting similar habits. In the forum, you can learn about other people’s experiences, tips and tricks or just express what’s on your mind. For some people, especially when being addicted to more harder substances, it might be hard to reach out to doctors, support groups or even friends and family. This is why the forum section is so valuable to Quitly. </p>
            <br>
            
                <p>As more and more users use Quitly or create custom habits, the more data we can work with. By implementing machine learning in our app, we can learn a lot about our users and their habits. We can much closely find and pinpoint when people are most likely going to cave in to their habits. With this data, we can help users when times get tough, give better motivation tips, add more premade habits and much more. Our goal is to gather people with the same bad habits, so they can find the support they need, without breaking a sweat.</p> <p>Quitting any bad habit is an individual journey, but receiving support makes the journey far easier than on your own.</p>
