           <div class = problemp> <p>Do you have a bad habit? Almost everyone has some type of negative behavior pattern they would like to quit. This can be anything from nail-biting, fidgeting, stereotyping to a drug addiction. Quitting can be difficult no matter what, especially without support and a way to keep track of how long you have quit. Amongst our dev team, we found out that we all had habits we wanted to quit. We also couldn’t find an easy way to help us actually quit these habits. The problem was then in simple terms that all humans develop habits they don’t necessarily want to continue with, but quitting them can often be difficult. Addiction is according to Psychology Today a condition that results when a person ingests a substance like alcohol or nicotine, or when a person engages in an activity such as gambling or shopping, that can be pleasurable, but becomes compulsive and interferes with responsibilities and concerns such as work, health or relationships<sup>1</sup>. Most people might not even be aware that their behavior is out of control and/or causing themselves or others around them problems. Bad habits don’t always have to be being addicted to drugs or other substances, but can also be small, non-harmful habits like fidgeting or twirling your hair. People are different, and so are their habits, which is why it is important to help everyone who wants to quit bad habits, no matter what it is.</p>
            
            
                <p>Struggling with addiction to more serious substances is of course tougher to deal with than fidgeting. According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 96% of addicts who are not seeking help, don’t believe they need treatment for help. The other 4% either felt they needed treatment but didn’t try to find it, or made an effort but didn’t receive treatment<sup>2</sup>. If we could even just help that tiny 4%, we would have reached our goal of helping people. Furthermore, this just shows that people don’t necessarily want treatment, but might want to quit on their own. It is also quite difficult for people struggling with an addiction to admit that there is a need for treatment because of the stigma surrounding addiction. Shame can be a very painful emotion, and when someone experiences this, they may feel as if they are not worthy of help or attention, which again makes it even harder to quit.</p> 
                <p> In conclusion, quitting habits are definitely a tough challenge, whatever it might be. Getting help might not be easy for many reasons, which is why we developed Quitly, to make this process easier to deal with.</p>
