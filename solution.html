            <div class = problemp> <p>Dealing with  bad habits might be something you would want do on your own, as sharing these problems might be taboo. That is why we created Quitly, to have a personal and at the same time anonymous way for dealing with quitting bad habits. To make quitting easier, we have made a forum section for people quitting similar habits. In the forum, you can learn about other people’s experiences, tips and tricks or just express what’s on your mind. For some people, especially when being addicted to more harder substances, it might be hard to reach out to doctors, support groups or even friends and family. This is why the forum section is so valuable to Quitly. </p>
            <br>
            
                <p>As more and more users use Quitly or create custom habits, the more data we can work with. By implementing machine learning in our app, we can learn a lot about our users and their habits. We can much closely find and pinpoint when people are most likely going to cave in to their habits. With this data, we can help users when times get tough, give better motivation tips, add more premade habits and much more. Our goal is to gather people with the same bad habits, so they can find the support they need, without breaking a sweat.</p>
                
                <br>
                <p> Here's how to use the app:<br>
                    Download the app for free. Signup is optional, if you don’t create a user, you’ll get a random, unique username which helps keep you private and anonymous on the app. Quilty already has a couple of already defined habits ready for you when you open the app.
                    If your habit isn’t on this list, no worries, you can easily add your own custom habit to quit. Quitly will also store the habit, so other users can also find this if they share the similar habit. On the custom screen, you have to add what you are quitting and why you are quitting. The why part is important, because Quitly can use this to help motivate you when you’re going through tough times. When you are done adding you own habit, a new screen will show you how long you have gone without. On this screen, you’ll also find the big “HELP” button, which is there for when you find quitting your habit difficult. Here you’ll be able to call a helpline, talk to other users and get motivation tips and help. Talking to other users is also an important feature in the app, which is why there is a dedicated forum for each habit. Here users will be mainly encouraged to help each other, but you can also vent about anything. Quitting might not be easy, which is why Quitly relies heavily on machine learning to help user quit. We use data like patterns when people need the most help, so we can predict and help users before they hit their lows. This way, you’re not only helping yourself, but others too when you use Quitly to quit your bad habits. 

                </p>
                
                <p>Quitting any bad habit is an individual journey, but receiving support makes the journey far easier than on your own.</p>
